Hello üòÄ!

In "main" branch You can find my Python machine learning projects üíª. Thay mainly uses PyTorch and OpenCV. You can find:
- a program that vefifies the ID
- a program that predicts another word of a text
- a simple computer vision program that classifies MNIST dataset
- program that predicts emotions from text
- program that process image using OpenCV
- program that classifies circle using ReLU layers
- simple prorgam that tests model with different optimizers and loss functions on MNIST data

In "sensor" branch You can find program to control the proximity sensor via ESP32 ·Ø§.

In the "car" branch, you can find a GUI and backend program that were programmed on NVIDIA Jetson üèé. 
The main idea of these programs is to receive data via CAN and display it in the GUI. 
GUI and backend communicates via pipes.
There is a lot of C++ code but it is not a whole project.
